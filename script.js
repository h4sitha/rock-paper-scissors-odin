// User enters their choice: Rock, Paper or Scissors
    // Use a prompt method for this

// Create a function to get random choice from [Rock, Paper, Scissors]
// to assign it as the computer's choice
    // Create an array containing the three choices
    // Create a new variable and assign it a random number from 1 to 3
    // Get the computer's choice by using the random number as the index for the array

// Rock beats Scissors
// Scissors beats Paper
// Paper beats Rock

// Create a new function to play the game
    // Get player's and computer's choices and use an if-else statments
    // to compare them to get their winner
    // Use logical operators to check the winner of the round
        // Players choose Rock and Computer choose Scissors 
    
    // Create two new variable to track player's wins and losses
        // Increment the relevant variable after each round
    // In the end compare these two value to declare the winner

// This is a 5 round game
// Create another function and keep the track of the rounds played
    // Create a new variable to store the number of rounds
    // Call the above function inside this function to play a round
    // Use a for loop to call the function until the rounds equal to 5
